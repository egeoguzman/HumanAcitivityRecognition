# Human Acitivity Recognition
The use of wireless sensors to track physical ac- tivity can help determine a personâ€™s postural orientation and movements in the real world. In this study, by using a publicly available human activity recognition dataset named PAMAP2 in the UCI Machine Learning Repository, feature selection and di- mensionality reduction will be applied for multiclass classification problem on human activities. In the study, Principal Component Analysis will be used for feature reduction and the data required for the implementation of PCA will be prepared on a distributed system, in a scalable manner, using the MapReduce approach. In addition, the insight required for exploratory data analysis and data cleaning will be provided with descriptive statistics prepared with the MapReduce approach. At the end of the study, one of the state-of-art machine learning models will be selected, tested on the transformed and the original data and the results will be compared. Another aim of the study is to determine the features that should be used in the PAMAP2 dataset with certain statistical methods, data analysis and machine learning algorithms in order to solve the human activity recognition problem.
